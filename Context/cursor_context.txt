PROJECT: PLView (MATLAB App Designer capstone)

PRIMARY GOAL:
Make this folder GitHub-ready (repo structure + README + essentials) WITHOUT changing any code.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS:
1) Do NOT modify PLView.mlapp or any .m source logic (no refactors, no path fixes, no renaming variables inside code).
2) You MAY move files and add new documentation files.
3) If there are hardcoded absolute paths or lab-specific dependencies, do NOT change them; document them in README under “Environment & Data Requirements”.
4) Ignore /dummy data/untitled.m completely.
5) Do not include any sensitive/patient data; keep demo data as-is (if present) and state privacy clearly.
6) Do not claim features unless proven by reading the code (PLView.mlapp) or existing docs.

WHAT PLVIEW IS (ONLY SAFE HIGH-LEVEL CLAIMS):
- MATLAB App Designer application (.mlapp).
- Intended for ECoG connectivity visualization using PLV (Phase Locking Value).
- Produces interactive visualizations including a 3D brain and a 2D connectivity view (if confirmed by code/UI labels).

REQUIRED OUTPUTS (FILES TO CREATE):
- README.md (professional, technical, no fluff)
- LICENSE (MIT)
- .gitignore (MATLAB focused)
- docs/user_guide.md
- docs/developer_notes.md
- (optional) CITATION.cff (only if you can fill it without guessing)

REPO ORGANIZATION TARGET:
- app/              -> contains PLView.mlapp
- assets/           -> contains head3d.mat / screenshots / logo if present
- data/             -> contains demo/sample input .mat files (if present) + schema notes
- docs/             -> guides and notes
- root files        -> README, LICENSE, .gitignore

IMPORTANT: MOVING FILES MUST NOT BREAK RUNTIME
- Because we are not allowed to edit code, moving files can break relative paths.
- Before moving anything, scan PLView.mlapp (export code if needed) and search for:
  load("..."), imread("..."), addpath("..."), fullfile(...), fopen(...), uigetfile filters, or any hardcoded relative paths.
- Only move a file if doing so will not break these references.
- If the code expects a file in a specific location, keep it there and document the expected location in README.

README REQUIREMENTS (GROUNDING RULES):
- Every feature listed must be supported by one of:
  A) UI component labels found in the .mlapp code (e.g., button names, dropdown items), OR
  B) functions/callback names or comments inside PLView.mlapp, OR
  C) existing project documentation files.
- If something is uncertain, mark it as “Depends on provided .mat structure / lab data” instead of asserting.

README SECTIONS (MANDATORY):
1) Overview (3–5 lines, purely factual)
2) What’s in this repo (short structure list)
3) Requirements (MATLAB version if found; toolboxes only if confirmed; otherwise say “MATLAB + required toolboxes as used by the app”)
4) How to run (open .mlapp; any required files; steps)
5) Input data format (extract real expected variable names from demo .mat or code; if not possible, document what can be inferred + a checklist)
6) Environment & Data Requirements
   - Document any absolute paths
   - Document any required external electrode metadata file(s)
   - Document head3d.mat expectation
7) Privacy
8) Limitations
9) Citation / Acknowledgments (only factual)

docs/user_guide.md:
- Step-by-step usage grounded in UI labels

docs/developer_notes.md:
- Architecture: main callbacks, data flow, where PLV is computed (based on code), where plots update
- List key functions and their roles (only if found in exported code)

SUCCESS CRITERION:
- Repo looks professional.
- README is accurate and sourced from the code/files.
- No code changes were made.
